An online retail store featuring various types of clothing. Introduction: My unique web application project will be an online store. The name of this store will be "Beni & O'Cumber." Beni and O'Cumber offers: Bottoms: Jeans, Shorts Footwear: Boots, Sneakers Outerwear: Coats, Jackets, Sweaters Tops: Shirts, T-Shirts

Core (and how it functions): The web application will be developed using HTML5, CSS3, and PostgreSQL. The database will be a relational database, and due to this being a small business, we will use a manual spreadsheet system for inventory control: Microsoft Excel. In addition, using a manual spreadsheet system will help keep costs low. In the event this business begins receiving heavy traffic, and we need to upgrade to a more efficient inventory control mechanism, we will purchase a Katana subscription. Katana is a cloud-based software that can manage warehouses, purchases, sale orders, and more. As for payment module(s), there will be acceptance of credit cards, debit cards, and PayPal. This payment module will be coded in-house, as using online plugins can limit revenue and website customization. Furthermore, each type of apparel (bottoms, footwear, outerwear, tops) will have its own page containing filters to select what subtype of apparel, for example jeans or shorts on the bottoms page. Lastly, the online store will have a shopping cart, which contains the customer's selected products.

Conclusion: This online store will provide a straight forward shopping experience to customers interested in purchasing apparel. By using HTML5, CSS3, PostgreSQL, and Excel, the store minimizes financial burden while using modern technology as its foundation and day-to-day operations.
